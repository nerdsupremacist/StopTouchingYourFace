During these strange times, it's important that we all remember that we shouldn't touuch our faces.

Here's SwiftUI App that alerts you when you have touched your face.
This happens to be an App version of my submission for the [WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/) 

## How does it work?

Well it uses a small (not great) CoreML Classification Model I created using Microsoft's [Custom Vision](https://www.customvision.ai). That classifies wether or not someone in the picture is touching their face. I say that it's not great, because I was lazy and only trained it with 200 images. 

Sine my model isn't amazing, I make sure that there's actually a face in the image with Visions [VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vndetectfacerectanglesrequest).

And the rest is just pretty SwiftUI code üòç

## Why?

Well like I said, this is a submission to the [WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/) so it's not obviously meant for production. This is just a proof of concept + an opportunity to try out some new things...
